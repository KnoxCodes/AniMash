* Install dependencies:
	+ Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
	+ Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
* Start the application:
	+ Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
	+ Backend: `cd backend && npm start`

## üöÄ GitHub Actions

The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and automates the following tasks:

* Builds and deploys the frontend application to Vercel
* Builds and starts the backend application
* Runs tests and linting checks for both frontend and backend

## üìÅ API Endpoints

The backend API provides the following endpoints:

* `GET /api/characters`: Retrieves a list of characters
* `POST /api/vote`: Handles voting data for a character
* `GET /api/leaderboard`: Returns the leaderboard rankings

## üíª Code Structure

The codebase is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`. The `frontend` directory contains the React application, while the `backend` directory contains the Express server and MongoDB integration.

Key files and directories:

* `frontend/src/main.jsx`: Main entry point for the frontend application
* `backend/index.js`: Main entry point for the backend application
* `backend/models/Character.js`: Mongoose model for characters
* `frontend/src/components/Home.jsx`: React component for the Home page
